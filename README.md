# Disease Prediction System

This is a Flask-based web application that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms using a machine learning model. The system integrates various datasets to provide detailed information about diseases, including descriptions, precautions, medications, diet recommendations, and workout suggestions.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts diseases based on symptoms using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.
- **Detailed Information**:
  - Disease description
  - Precautions to take
  - Medications
  - Recommended diet
  - Suggested workouts
- **Static Pages**:
  - About
  - Contact
  - Developer information
  - Blog
- **Error Handling**: Validates input symptoms and provides user-friendly error messages for invalid or missing inputs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/praveen-ku12345/AI-Driven-Health-Care-Assistant.git
   cd disease-prediction-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Place Model and Data Files**:
   - Ensure the `svc.pkl` file is placed in the project directory.
   - Place the following CSV files in the `data` folder:
     - `symptoms_df.csv`
     - `precautions_df.csv`
     - `workout_df.csv`
     - `description.csv`
     - `medications.csv`
     - `diets.csv`

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. Enter symptoms in the provided input field as a comma-separated list (e.g., "fever, cough, headache").
2. Click on the "Predict" button to get the disease prediction and detailed information.
3. Navigate through the static pages for additional information about the app and its developers.
